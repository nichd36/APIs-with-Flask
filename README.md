# REST APIs with Flask

## Introduction

This webapp combines Next.js as the frontend and Flask as the backend. This was done as I needed fastparquet and pandas, which are Python libraries.

This repo is a part of my ongoing project, which delves in data processing and visualization.

## Key Points
- **Obtain and read parquet files**
- **Process and provide processed data via APIs**: "/api/process_parquet" will return a preview of the dataset.

## Note
- Branch **main** is linked to production *environment*
- Branch **staging** is linked to production *preview*
