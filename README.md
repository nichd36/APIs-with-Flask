# REST APIs with Flask

## Introduction

This webapp combines Next.js as the frontend and Flask as the backend. This was done as I needed fastparquet and pandas, which are Python libraries.

This repo is a part of my ongoing project, which delves in data processing and visualization.

## Key points
- Obtain and read parquet files
- Process and provide processed data via APIs
